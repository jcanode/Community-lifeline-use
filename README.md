# Community Lifeline


Have you ever needed help that did not require an emergency call to 9-1-1 but was still an emergency to you? It happens to numerous amounts of people everyday, whether they are located in an urban or rural area. Our goal with Help is to provide a platform that allows quick help requests that fellow humans can fulfill for you right away! Your safety is important.
